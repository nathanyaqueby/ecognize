# PR🌍MPTERRA (by team ECOGNIZE)

As programmers, we always tend to copy-paste our code into ChatGPT (along with their errors) no matter how long the prompt is or how much computation power it takes in the background.
This is not a sustainable approach, especially with 180.5 million users on the platform doing the same thing. 

With PR🌍MPTERRA, we want to help people learn how to build the perfect sustainable prompts!
